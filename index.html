        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>  
          <li>Elements are types of content found on a webpage. They are composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented by angle brackets ("< >"). Some can be visible to the user, and others are not. There are four common element types:
            <ol>
              <li>Text Elements</li>
              <li>Image Elements</li>
              <li>Header Elements</li>
              <li>List Elements</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>There's also elements used to divide & structure content:
            <ol>
              <li>Semantic Elements</li>
              <li>Content division Elements</li>
              <li>Meta-related Elements</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. This information is known as "metadata", which helps the brower render the webpage. Child elements within the head element are not visible to the user.</li>
          <li>The body element contains content for the page which can be viewed by the user. Elements we want the user to see and interact with must be placed here.</li>
          <li>Like head elements, there are also Semantic elements. Semantic elements are children of the body, but are there to properly structure the page. For example.
            <ol>
              <li>Header</li>
            The header is the first step in body element organisation. It appears at the top of the page, and usually contains a navigation menu and introductory content.
              <li>Main</li>
              The main is the main area of content for the body. It provides the user with chunks of information and resources.
              <li>Footer</li>
              The footer appears at the bottom of a apge, usually containing information such as author, copyright, contacts, sitemaps and further navigation.
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A programming language used to define how webpage content is presented to users (formatting html with stylistic rules and options)</li>
          <li>There are 3 types of CSS styling options:
            <ol>
              <li>Inline CSS</li>
              Used to style an element directly in the html file (inside an element tag).
              <li>Internal CSS</li>
              Used to style elements within the head element of a html file (inside the head, style child element)
              <li>External CSS</li>
              Separate, linked CSS files referenced in the head of the html page which allows devs to remotely edit CSS rules in another document.
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>In a declaration block, start off with the selector, followed by curved brackets, with a property:value; end bracket.
            Like such: div {color:blue; text-align: justify;}
          </li>
          <li>There are lots of properties in CSS, however some basic structural properties include margin, padding, text-align, and display.
            <ul>
              <li>Margin: Indicates how much space is wanted outside of an element</li>
              <li>Padding: Indicates how much space is wanted inside the element</li>
              <li>Text-align: A way to center or displace an element on an axis</li>
              <li>Display: Displays content on the page differently depending on the value attributed.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>You can also attribute CSS rules to a whole bunch of elements under the same code using class selectors. Attributing a class to a html element will allow you to use it as a CSS selector via .classname</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is an open-source version control system which allows devs to collaborate, edit, upload and share work to coworkers. It can also be used to navigate around your local system using an array of commands.</li>
          <li>Some normal navigation commands include
            <ol>
              <li>pwd - shows you your current directory</li>
              <li>cd - lets you change directories</li>
              <li>cd .. - lets you move back one directory</li>
              <li>ls - shows you all files in the current directory</li>
              <li>mkdir - creates a new directory</li>
              <li>touch - creates a new file in current directory</li>
              <li>start - runs a file</li>
              <li>rm - removes a file</li>
              <li>rm -r - removes a directory</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>During collaboration, developers will have to utilize "Branches", which are clones of main branch codebases which allow further editing. These can also be accessed via commands.
            <ol>
              <li>git - precedes every git related command</li>
              <li>checkout - moves working branch to the branch specified</li>
              <li>-b - creates new branch</li>
              <li>feature/develop - state the type of branch</li>
              <li>status - tells you what branch you're on</li>
              <li>add - adds branch modifications</li>
              <li>-A - specifies to add all modifications, or add all __</li>
              <li>pull - pulls branch into local environment</li>
              <li>origin - specifies the source of the branch (repository) via the directory that is linked to GitHub</li>
              <li>main - specifies name of branch you want to pull</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
