## Description

This project provides some basic overview notes on different programming languages and techniques utilized often in web development. 
Seeing how so many Bootcamp students struggle with the pre-work stage, it was a primary goal of mine to gather all information
necessary to succeed in this environment, and place it in an easily-accessible website for all to see. Despite my will to help others,
I also learned a lot along the way - further strengthening my understanding of basic programming concepts and web development.
